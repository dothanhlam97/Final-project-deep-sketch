Train data
1. Gradient vector (Using Solbel). 
=> direction + gradient value 
2. Summary gradient vector and divide into k bins (histogram). It means divide 180 degree into k parts. Each bins contains all gradient vector which have direction in each parts. 
3. normalize data by rotate, smooth,... 
4. Calculate confident (improve accurracy)
5. Use SVM to recognize.

Predict
